# Trees

## Challenge

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

## Approach & Efficiency
use recursion within tree classes to create the expected array output

## API

Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
Can successfully add a left child and right child to a single root node
Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal
