# multi bracket valedation
check to see if there are equal brackets in a string


## Challenge
given a string, check if there are brackets, and if there are, check to see if the brackets are balanced, i.e. if there is an opening bracket and a closing bracket of the same type. if so return true, if not, return false 

## Approach & Efficiency
in essence, loop through the given string and compare it to the given bracket values, pushing into a stack and checking each character of the string

## Solution
using the test file to send stings into the function and check them accordingly and return the appropriate statment of true or false depending on the given input
