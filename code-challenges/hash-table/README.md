# Hash Tables

## What is a Hash Table

A hash table (often called a hash map) is a data structure that maps keys to values. Hash tables combine lookup, insert, and delete operations in an efficient way. The key is sent to a hash function that performs arithmetic operations on it. The result (called the hash value or hash) is an index of the key-value pair.
